## Show up ready

You open your camera before an important call and something feels off. Is the camera too low? Is the lighting washing you out? Is the background distracting? By the time you work it out, the moment has already begun.

Presence gives you a calm, private space to prepare. It looks at the parts of your camera view you can change, including framing, lighting, face position, background, and color balance, and turns them into simple actions you can take right away.

**Presence does not judge who you are.** It does not score your personality, ability, attractiveness, or professional potential. It helps you shape the setting around you so that you can enter the moment feeling prepared and present.

## Made for the moments that matter

| Your moment        | How Presence helps                                                    |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Job interview**  | Create a composed, prepared camera view before the first question     |
| **Online meeting** | Look clear, attentive, and ready to participate in everyday calls     |
| **Presentation**   | Build a confident visual presence before the first slide              |
| **Profile photo**  | Capture an image that feels natural, polished, and recognizably yours |

## Start with the highest-stakes moment

Presence begins with **online interviews for job seekers**: a focused group with an urgent, repeatable need and a clear before-and-after outcome. In about 30 seconds, a candidate can check the camera setup, act on a short list of improvements, and recapture to verify the change before joining the interview.

The same workflow can later expand through university career centers, interview-coaching services, and recruiting platforms, then into meetings, presentations, and profile photos. This gives Presence a narrow entry point without limiting its long-term reach.

## A better setup in about 30 seconds

| Tell Presence whether you are preparing for an interview, meeting, presentation, or profile photo. | Review your face position, framing, brightness, and background in real time. | Receive a short report focused on improvements you can make immediately. | Adjust your setup, capture again, and compare the before and after. |

If camera access is not available, you can upload a JPG or PNG and follow the same guided experience.

## Guidance you can actually use

Presence does more than list analysis results. It translates visual signals into practical suggestions for your real environment:

- Raise or reposition your camera for a more balanced composition.
- Adjust the direction or brightness of your light so your face is clear.
- Reduce background elements that compete for attention.
- Coordinate clothing and background colors with the way your skin tone appears on camera.
- Compare your original view with the improved version side by side.

The goal is not simply to say that one image looks better. Presence helps you understand **what changed, why it matters, and what to do next**.

## Your image, your choice

Privacy is an integral part of the Presence experience.

- **No account required:** Presence does not ask for your name, email address, or user profile.
- **Live checks stay on your device:** Your continuous camera feed and real-time framing checks are not sent to a server.
- **Nothing is sent without an action:** An image is used for analysis only after you choose **Create report**.
- **Images are optimized before upload:** Photos are reduced in the browser before they are submitted for analysis.
- **A demo is always available:** You can explore the complete product experience with a sample report and without sending a photo to YouCam.

A dedicated privacy policy inside the product explains the experience in full.

## Powered by YouCam intelligence

Presence combines Perfect Corp.'s **YouCam AI Skin Analysis**, **Skin Tone Analysis**, and **Photo Lighting** to understand how lighting, color, and camera conditions affect your appearance on screen. Photo Lighting is an optional enhancement, so a temporary failure does not block the core report.

These signals are never presented as a measure of beauty or personal worth. Presence uses them only as context for aspects of the scene you can control, such as lighting direction, visual clarity, and color harmony, and reshapes them into respectful, actionable guidance.

The report makes that transformation explicit:

1. **YouCam API signals** show the returned appearance-related measurements.
2. **Presence interpretation** combines those signals with on-device framing and lighting checks to suggest controllable changes.
3. **Recapture verification** asks the user to apply the guidance and compare a new image instead of treating a projected improvement as a measured result.

## Architecture protected by Boundra

Presence uses [Boundra](https://www.npmjs.com/package/boundra) to keep its `analysis`, `appearance-guidance`, `camera`, and `comparison` domains explicit as the prototype grows.

- Domain manifests declare the allowed dependency graph and public APIs.
- Single-layer domains keep their public API directly at the domain root, while mixed client/server domains retain explicit layer folders.
- The image-analysis mutation validates both its browser input and server result at runtime.
- The Vite development overlay reports contract and boundary failures while coding.
- `pnpm check:boundaries` runs the same architecture guard directly, and `pnpm graph:domains` prints the domain graph.

## What the Presence experience includes

- Preparation modes tailored to interviews, meetings, presentations, and profile photos
- Real-time camera readiness guidance
- A focused journey from capture to analysis, improvement, and recapture
- Personalized appearance guidance powered by YouCam analysis
- Side-by-side before-and-after comparison
- Korean and English language support
- A responsive experience across desktop and mobile
- Clear privacy controls and a no-account experience

> Presence is currently a hackathon prototype. It is not a medical or diagnostic product, and it does not provide identity verification or evaluations of personality, ability, attractiveness, or professional potential.
